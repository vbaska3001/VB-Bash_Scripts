# VB-Bash_Scripts

This repository contains Bash scripts that I created to practice and showcase my skills in shell scripting.
Each script was written and tested by me, focusing on simple automation tasks and problem-solving.

# Scripts and Usage:
  • Memory_Monitor.sh - To get the processes consuming higher memory and report them using Warning messages.
  • OS_Update.sh - To check and update the OS in Linux systems based on the distro available in the system.
  • Ping_Script2.sh - To check network connectivity using Ping command in clients.
  
# What’s Inside:
•	Basic scripts to work with files, directories, and text.
	•	Scripts that use loops, conditions, and functions.
	•	My own logic added for error handling, automation, and user inputs.

# Steps to Run:
git clone https://github.com/vbaska3001/VB-Bash_Scripts.git
cd VB-Bash_Scripts
chmod +x script_name.sh
./script_name.sh

# Why this repo?
This repo is a small showcase of:
	•	My Bash scripting knowledge.
